# cognos-reports-xml-to-database

Not all versions of Cognos BI offer a way to export BI report metadata in a structured format. 
Due to business rules changing over time, it is useful to be able to access the report metadata in a structure format in the case that a data field has been modified and all report containing that data field need to be altered.
This program takes metadata from Cognos BI reports and extracts the information necessary then compiles it into a structured format.
This progam has been written to export to a database as well as an Excel file.
